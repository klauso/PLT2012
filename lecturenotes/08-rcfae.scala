 * Let's try to write a function that computes the sum of the first n integers.
 * Let's pretend we do not know that the sum of the first n integers is n*(n+1)/2
 * and instead compute the sum in a loop. Let's try to do this in FAE (with if0):

/* Let's now consider the semantics of letrec. Consider the evaluation of
 * Letrec(x,e,body) in an environment env.
 *
 * What environment should we use to evaluate e and body, respectively?
 * Using env for e will produce a ClosureV(Fun('n,...'sum'...),env), and hence
 * the environment when evaluating body will be
 * envbody = env + (x -> ClosureV(Fun('n,...'sum...),env))
 * This is bad, because the env in the closure does not contain a binding for sum and hence the
 * recursive invocation will fail. The environment in the closure must contain
 * a mapping for 'sum. Hence envbody should look like
 * envbody = env + (x -> ClosureV(Fun('n, ...'sum...), 
 *                                env+('sum -> ClosureV(Fun('n,...'sum...),env)))
 * 
 * This looks better, but now the second closure contains an environment with no
 * binding of 'sum. What we need is an environment that satisfies the equation:
 *
 * envbody = env + (x -> ClosureV(Fun('n, ...'sum..), envbody))
 *
 * Obviously envbody must be circular. There are different ways to create such a circular
 * environment. We will choose mutation to create a circle. More specifically, we use
 * a mutable Map (initialized to env) as environment when evaluating e and then mutate
 * the environment to include a mapping from x to the evaluated closure.
 *
 * To be able to use both mutable and immutable maps as environments, we define:
