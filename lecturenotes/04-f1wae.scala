/* In the last lecture we have seen how we can give commonly occuring (sub)expressions a
 * name via the "with" construct. Often, however, we can identify _patterns_ of expressions
 * that occur in many places, such as "5*5/2", "7*7/2" and "3*3/2", the common pattern
 * being "x*x/2". In this case, the abstraction capabilities of "with" are not sufficient.
 * 
 * One way to enable more powerful abstractions are _functions_. Depending on the context
 * of use and the interaction with other language features (such as imperative features or objects),
 * functions are also sometimes called _procedures_ or _methods_.
 *
 * Here we consider so-called first-order functions, that - unlike higher-order functions - are
 * not expressions and can hence not be passed to or be returned from other functions. First-order
 * functions are simply called by name.
 *
 * To introduce first-order functions, we need two new things: The possibility to define functions,
 * and the possibility to call functions. A call to a function is an expression, whereas functions
 * are defined separately. Functions can have an arbitrary number of arguments.

/* The new language constructs for first-order functions: */
case class Call(f: Symbol, args: List[Exp]) extends Exp // functions are called by name

/* A function has a number of formal args and a body. A first-order function also
 * has a name. To make the invariant that there can only be one function for each
 * name explicit, we store functions in the form of a map from function names to FunDefs: */

case class FunDef(args: List[Symbol], body: Exp)

/* But is the extension really so straightforward?  It can be seen in the last line that our
 * substitution deliberately ignores the function name `f'.  We say in this case that function
 * names and variable names live in different "name spaces".  An alternative would be to have a 
 * common namespace.
 */

/* We will first study a "reference interpreter" based on substitution.
 * We pass the map of functions as an additional parameter. */

    // arguments with their respective argument values.

 *
 * As can be seen in the example above, each function can "see" the other functions.
 * We say that in this language functions have a _global scope_.
 *
 * Exercise: Can a function also invoke itself? Is this useful? */

/* We will now study an environment-based version of the interpreter.
 * To motivate environments, consider the following sample program: */

/* At this point only pure arithmetic is left. But we see that the interpreter
 * had to apply subsitution three times. In general, if the program size is n,
 * then the interpreter may perform up to O(n) substitutions, each of which
 * takes O(n) time. This quadratic complexity seems rather wasteful. Can we do better? */

/* We can avoid the redundancy by deferring the substitutions until they are really needed. 
 * Concretely, we define a repository of deferred substitutions, called _environment_. 
 * It tells us which identifiers are supposed to be eventually substituted by which value.
 * This idea is captured in the following type definition: */

type Env = Map[Symbol, Int]

/* Initially, we have no substitutions to perform, so the repository is empty. Every time we encounter a 
 * construct (a with or application) that requires substitution, we augment the repository with one more entry,
 * recording the identiﬁer’s name and the value (if eager) or expression (if lazy) it should eventually be
 * substituted with. We continue to evaluate without actually performing the substitution.
 *
 * This strategy breaks a key invariant we had established earlier, which is that any identiﬁer the interpreter
 * could encounter must be free, for had it been bound, it would have already been substituted.  Now that we’re
 * longer using the substitution-based model, we may encounter bound identiﬁers during interpretation.  How do we
 * handle them?  We must substitute them by consulting the repository.

/* Obviously this interpreter is "buggy" in the sense that it does not agree with the substitution-based interpreter.
 * But is this semantics reasonable? 
 * 
 * Let's introduce some terminology to make the discussion simpler:
 
 * Deﬁnition (Static Scope): In a language with static scope, the scope of an identiﬁer’s binding is a syntactically delimited region.
 * A typical region would be the body of a function or other binding construct.
 
 * Deﬁnition (Dynamic Scope): In a language with dynamic scope, the scope of an identiﬁer’s binding is
 * the entire remainder of the execution during which that binding is in effect.

 * We see that eval and evalWithEnv give our language static scoping, whereas evalDynScope gives our language
 * dynamic scoping. 
 *
 * Armed with this terminology, we claim that dynamic scope is entirely unreasonable. The problem is
 * that we simply cannot determine what the value of a program will be without knowing everything about its
 * execution history. If the function f were invoked by some other sequence of functions that did not bind a
 * value for n, then that particular application of f would result in an error, even though a previous application
 * of f in the very same program’s execution completed successfully! In other words, simply by looking at the
 * source text of f, it would be impossible to determine one of the most rudimentary properties of a program:
 * whether or not a given identiﬁer was bound. You can only imagine the mayhem this would cause in a large
 * software system, especially with multiple developers and complex ﬂows of control. We will therefore regard
 * dynamic scope as an error */
