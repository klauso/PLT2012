/* This lecture consists of two parts.  The first part goes from evaluators to
 * abstract machines.  The second part goes the other way around.  In the
 * first part, our object-language is the call-by-name lambda-calculus.  In
 * the second part, our object-language is the call-by-value lambda-calculus.
 * For both parts, we use the **de-Bruijn-index** notation for
 * lambda-expressions.  (Please find more about de-Bruijn-index notation on
 * Wikipedia.)  Our meta-language is Scala as usual.
 *
 * =From Evaluators to Abstract Machines=
 *
 * In this part, we will look at how to derive an abstract machine, called
 * Krivine's machine, for the call-by-name lambda-calculus, from a standard
 * interpreter by a series of program transformations.
 *
 * ==Higher-Order Function== 
 *
 * This interpreter implements the call-by-name lambda-calculus.  It features
 * meta-level higher-order functions in the following two senses:
 *
 * # Object-level first-class functions are implemented by meta-level
 *   first-class functions and object-level function application is
 *   implemented by meta-level function application.  Since object-level
 *   functions are higher-order, meta-level functions implementing them must
 *   also be higher-order.
 *
 * # Since {{eval}} returns such meta-level functions as results, {{eval}} is
 *   higher-order too.

}

/* Note that in the implementation of {{HOF}}, the evaluation order of the
 * object-language depends on the evaluation order of the meta-language.  The
 * dependence manifests at {{fun(eval(opd, env))}}.  
 *
 * On one hand, if the meta-language uses call-by-value, which happens to be
 * so for Scala, the object-language is forced to be call-by-value; if instead
 * the meta-language uses call-by-name, the object-language becomes
 * call-by-name too.
 *
 * On the other hand, if the meta-language uses call-by-value but we want the
 * object-languge to be call-by-name, a special construct that can delay
 * evaluation must be introduced into the meta-language; if the meta-language
 * uses call-by-name but we want the object-language to be call-by-value, a
 * special construct that can force evaluation must be introduced into the
 * meta-language.  In either case, the meta-language must be extended, which
 * sometimes may be difficult or impossible.
 *
 * Fortunately a program transformation technique can solve both problems
 * gracefully, eliminating the evaluation-order dependence between the
 * object-language and meta-language, that is, by transforming the interpreter
 * into continuation-passing style.
 *
 * But to make life a bit easier, let us first get rid of meta-level
 * first-class functions that implement object-level first-class functions.
 *
 * ==Closure Conversion==
 *
 * **Closure conversion** converts the representation of object-level
 * first-class functions to meta-level data structures, namely **closures**.
 * The consequences are twofold:
 *
 * # It eliminates the use of meta-level first-class functions to represent
 *   object-level first-class functions.
 *
 * # It turns meta-level higher-order functions back to first-order,
 *   particularly {{eval}}.
 * 
 * Keeping from meta-level first-class functions but with meta-level
 * first-order functions opens more choices of meta-languages for
 * implementation.  For example, a language like C that does not natively
 * support first-class functions can be used.
 *
 * After closure conversion, we have an interpreter in **direct style**, that
 * is, not manipulating explicit continuations.

 *
 * The problem of evaluation-order dependence between the object-language and

 * conversion, as evidenced by {{eval(bod, eval(opd, env) :: sen)}}.  To solve
 * the problem without extending the meta-language, we must turn to
 * CPS-transformation.
 *
 * As to see how to implement a call-by-name language in a call-by-value
 * language without extending the meta-language, we decide our object-language
 * to be the call-by-name lambda-calculus and use the **call-by-name
 * CPS-transformation** to transform the interpreter from direct style into
 * continuation-passing style.
 *
 * The result of the transformation has the following features:
 *
 * # The evaluation order of the object-language is call-by-name.  It no
 *   longer depends on the evaluation order of the meta-language.  Even if
 *   someday Scala switches to call-by-name, our interpreter still correctly

/* ==Defunctionalization==
 *
 * **Defunctionalization** is a general program transformation technique that
 * eliminates higher-order functions, by replacing the creation of
 * first-class functions with the construction of data structures and the
 * application of first-class functions with the destruction of data
 * structures.
 *
 * A program that contains higher-order functions can be defunctionalized 
 * following three steps:
 *
 * # Encoding --- Identify first-class functions in the program and classify
 *   them according to their types.  For each function type, introduce an
 *   encoding data type.  For each function instance (i.e., function of the
 *   encoded function type) introduce a constructor that will construct data
 *   of the encoding type.  Make sure that each data constructor takes
 *   arguments that have the same types as the free variables of the function
 *   instance.  The idea is that each constructor should save the values bound
 *   to the free variables of the function instance.  Encoding should not
 *   cause any informatoin loss.
 *
 * # Decoding --- For each encoding data type, define a function
 *   (conventionally called "apply") that takes one argument of the data type
 *   and the other of the argument type of the encoded function type.  This
 *   "apply" function will use pattern matching to do case analysis on its
 *   first argument in order to extract the saved values bound to the free
 *   variables of the encoded function instance.  The right-hand side of each
 *   case will be the body of the encoded function instance, with variables
 *   renamed accordingly.
 *
 * # Refactoring --- Go through the program.  When an encoded function type is
 *   met, replace it with its encoding data type.  When a function instance is
 *   met, encode it by constructing data from its free variables using the
 *   corresponding constructor.  In this way, values bound to the free
 *   variables of the function instance are saved.  Locate all the places
 *   where a function instance is applied, replacing its application with an
 *   explict call of the "apply" function on (the designator of) the function
 *   instance and its argument.
 *
 * We illustrate how to defunctionalize a higher-order program following these
 * two steps by an example.  Below is a simple higher-order program that
 * defines a function that will first add {{n}} to and then multiply by {{n}}
 * every integer in a list {{xs}}.
 */
def map(f: Int => Int, xs: List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {

  case x :: xs => f(x) :: map(f, xs)
}

def addMulInts(n: Int, xs: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  map(x => x * n, map(x => x + n, xs))

/* Let us apply the three-step procedure to this program.
 *
 * # Encoding
 *
 *   There are two first-class functions in the program, namely {{x = > x *
 *   n}} and {{x => x + n}}.  Both are instances of the type {{Int => Int}}r.
 *   Therefore we only need to introduce one data type, call it {{IntF}}.
 *   Both functions also have {{n}} of type {{Int}} as their free variables.
 *   So we introduce two data constructors, call them {{AddN}} and {{MulN}}
 *   respectively.  Each takes an argument {{n}} of type {{Int}}.
 */

/* # Decoding
 *
 *   Next we define the "apply" function which takes one argument of type
 *   {{IntF}} and the other argument of the argument type of the encoded
 *   function type {{Int => Int}}, that is, {{Int}}.  The "apply" function
 *   will distinguish two cases, {{MulN(n)}} or {{AddN(n)}}, and respectively
 *   add {{n}} to or multiply by {{n}} its second argument.  Note that we use
 *   the same names ("x" and "n" respectively) for the second parameter and
 *   the pattern variable of each case in {{apply}}, as those for the
 *   parameter and free variable in each encoded function instance, so that we
 *   are not concerned with variable renaming and can put the body of the
 *   encoded function instance as is directly to the right-hand side of each
 *   case.  But normally, renaming variables in the body of the encoded
 *   function instance is required, for instance, if the second function

 *   n}}.

 *   we replace the two function instances {{x => x * n}} and {{x => x + n}}
 *   in the body of {{AddMulInts}} by {{MulN(n)}} and {{AddN(n)}}
 *   respectively.  Note that both functions will be bound to {{f}} and passed
 *   in to {{map}}.  In other words, where {{f}} is applied in {{map}} is
 *   where these function instances are applied.  Thus the third is to replace

 * Next observe another structual similarity between constructors of data type
 * {{Ctn}} and those of Scala's built-in generic type {{List[T]}}: {{IdC}} is
 * isomorphic to {{Nil}} and {{ApC}} is isomorphic to {{::}} if we group
 * {{Exp}} and {{Env}} together as one data type, naturally {{Clo}}.  Thanks
 * to this isomorphism, we can use {{Nil}} and {{::}} in place of {{IdC}} and
 * {{ApC}}.  In other words, we can listify continuations.
 *
 * Again we can inline {{apCt}}. 
 *
 * Finally, we modify the return type of {{eval}} to be the triple {{(Exp,

 * can be viewd as a state transition function:
 *
 *   (Exp, Env, Ctn) ==eval=> (Exp, Env, Ctn)

/* ==Krivine's Abstract Machine==
 *
 * An abstract machine is a conceptual model of a computer system.  It seems
 * a machine because it allows step-by-step program execution.  It is abstract
 * in that it leaves out lots of subtle details of real machines.  A **virtual
 * machine** (like the JVM) can be similarly charaterized except that it laso
 * has an instruction set.  Source programs must first be compiled to object
 * programs in these instructions before they can be executed by a virtual
 * machine.  An abstract machine does not have such an instruction set and in
 * turn it executes source programs directly.  In this sense, an abstract
 * machine works like an interpreter.  Like a real machine, an abstract
 * machine also has states and works by updating states.  In other words, one
 * run of an abstract machine can be viewed as a series of state transition.
 * To understand an abstract machine boils down to understand its states and
 * transition function.
 *
 * We present here an abstract machine, called Krivine's machine (simply
 * K-machine), for the call-by-name lambda-calculus.  The K-machine has three
 * registers: Exp to store lambda-expressions, Env to keep thunks, and Ctn
 * to save continuations.  The triple (Exp, Env, Ctn) completely renders the
 * state of the K-machine.  Before we see the transition function of the
 * K-machine, we need to know the syntax for things stored in these three
 * registers.
 *
 * The syntax for lambda-expressions is:
 *
 *   (expression)  e ::= i    (index)
 *                     | \ e  (abstraction)
 *                     | e e  (application)
 *
 * That is, a lambda-expression can be a natural number (as de-Bruijn index
 * for a nameless variable), or "\" (mimicing the look of the Greek letter
 * lambda) followed by an expression (together notating lambda-abstraction,
 * designating anonymous function), or two expressions juxtaposed (together
 * designating function application).  Here are some lambda-expressions in
 * this syntax (call it "de Bruijn") and Scala syntax:
 *
 *   | de Bruijn | Scala                       |
 *   | \ 0       | (x : Any) => x              |
 *   | \ \ 1     | (x : Any) => (y : Any) => x |
 *
 * Recall that de-Bruijn indices for a lambda-abstraction start with 0 from
 * the innermost lambda-bound variable and count outward.  Thus the inner
 * parameter {{y}} in the example {{(x : Any) => (y : Any) => x}} is indexed
 * {{0}}, the outer {{x}} indexed {{1}}.  Hence the body of the de-Bruijn
 * notation is {{1}}.  Note that Scala is typed whereas the pure
 * lambda-calculus is not.  That is why there is no type annotation in the
 * corresponding lambda-expression in de-Bruijn syntax.
 * 
 * The syntax for environments is:
 *
 *   (environment) r ::= []
 *                     | (e, r) :: r
 *
 * That is, an environment is either empty or a thunk bundled with other
 * thunks accumulated into another environment.
 *
 * The syntax for continuation is as follows:
 *
 *   (continuation) c ::= []
 *                      | (e, r) :: c
 *
 * That is, a continuation is either nothing (left to do) or "to apply to a
 * thunk" bundled with to-dos afterwards which manifests as another
 * continuation.
 *
 * Notice that even though environments and continuations have isomorphic
 * syntactic structure, they have different interpretations as clearly stated
 * above.
 *
 * Now we are ready to see the state-transition function of the K-machine.  It
 * is given by three transition rules (numbered from 1 to 3) presented in the
 * following table:
 *
 * | (Exp , Env, Ctn          ) | ----> | (Exp, Env          , Ctn         ) |
 * | (i   , r  , c            ) | --1-> | (e1 , r1           , c           ) |
 * |                            |       |          where r(i) = (e1, r1)     |
 * | (\ e , r  , (e1, r1) :: c) | --2-> | (e  , (e1, r1) :: r, c           ) |
 * | (e e1, r  , c            ) | --3-> | (e  , r            , (e1, r) :: c) |
 *
 * Each transition rule covers one-step transition of states.  A run of the
 * K-machine is a series of these transition steps.  There must be an initial
 * state and a final state.  Let the lambda-program to be executed on the
 * K-machine, in other words, the lambda-expression to be evaluated by the
 * K-machine, be e.  The initial state of a run will always be (e, [], []),
 * that is, with the register Exp initialized to e, and the register Env to
 * empty and the register Ctn to nothing.  The final states of runs for
 * different expressions may be different.  But two things are common: the
 * machine halts when there is nothing left to do, that is, the register Ctn
 * must be [].  So the final state will always have the pattern (e, r, []).
 * e in the register Exp together with r in the register Env could be taken as
 * the result.  Let us take a simple example, {{(\ 0) (\ 0)}}, and simulate
 * its run on the K-machine.
 *
 *         ( Exp        , Env            , Ctn             )
 *         ( (\ 0) (\ 0), []             , []              )
 *   --3-> ( \ 0        , []             , (\ 0, []) :: [] )
 *   --2-> ( 0          , (\ 0, []) :: [], []              )
 *   --1-> ( \ 0        , []             , []              )
 * 
 * To see another example, {{(\ \ 1) (\ 0)}}, in run:
 *
 *         ( Exp          , Env            , Ctn             )
 *         ( (\ \ 1) (\ 0), []             , []              )
 *   --3-> ( \ \ 1        , []             , (\ 0, []) :: [] )
 *   --2-> ( \ 1          , (\ 0, []) :: [], []              )
 *
 * This example shows that in the final state, the register Env does not
 * necessarily hold the empty environment.
 *
 * As an exercise, try to simulate the execution of {{((\ \ 1) (\ 0)) (\ 0)}}
 * on the K-machine.
 *
 * We see that to evaluate a lambda-expression e, the K-machine sets the
 * initial state to (e, [], []), applies the three transition rules repeatedly
 * (for zero or more times) until the register Ctn holds [] again, which means
 * there is nothing left to do, and then halts.  This hints the following idea
 * for an implementation of the K-machine: we can define a Scala function,
 * {{red1(exp : Exp, env : Env, ctn : Ctn) : (Exp, Env, Ctn)}}, and then form
 * a do-while loop with a loop variable {{s : (Exp, Env, Ctn)}} initialized to
 * {{(exp, [], [])}}, with a loop condition checking whether {{ctn}} is [],
 * and in the body tries to apply one of the transition rules.  The actual
 * implementation is left as an exercise.
 *
 * We finally remark that {{KAM}} we have defined above is indeed such an
 * implementation.  Note that {{eval}} is tail-recursive, thus it is
 * equivalent to a loop in effect.  The difference between {{eval}} and
 * {{red1}} is: the former implements a big-step transition, while the latter
 * a small-step transition.
 *
 * To conclude, we have demonstrated how to reach an abstract-machine-level
 * impelementation of the call-by-name lambda-calculus from a high-level
 * implementation using higher-order features by performing a series of
 * program transformations on the evaluators.  Next, we will do reverse
 * engineering: we will start with an abstract-machine-level implementation of
 * the call-by-value lambda-calculus, do the reverse of those program
 * transformations we have seen, and reach a high-level implementation using
 * higher-order features.
