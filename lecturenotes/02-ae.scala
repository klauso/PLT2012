 * That said, to make writing examples less verbose, Scala's implicits
 * come to the rescue.
 
 * Calls to implicit functions are inserted automatically by the compiler

 * mappings from Identifiers (which we represent as symbols) to Values.
 * In our simple language the only values are integers, hence: */

 * evaluator would be to add an abstract "eval" method to the Exp class and
 * override it in all subclasses, each implementation corresponding to its
 * corresponding case in the pattern match. The choice between these alternatives
 * matters, since they support different dimensions of extensibility.
 *
 * We will mainly use the more functional style using pattern matching, because
 * it matches better to the order in which we present these topics in the lecture.
 *
 * To try the example, we need a sample environment that gives values to the 
 * (free) variables in the sample expression. The test environment also illustrates
 * how Scala supports direct definitions of constant maps.

/* We will now learn a different way to encode algorithms that operate on 
 * expressions (like the evaluator).
 * To this end, we will now use so-called "folds". Folds are well-known
 * for lists, but the concept is more general and applies to arbitrary
 * algebraic data types.
 *
 * We will present folds in such a style that they resemble visitors as known
 * from the OO design pattern literature. They correspond to so-called
 * "internal visitors" in which the traversal is encoded within the "accept" function.
 
 * An internal visitor consists of one function for each syntactic construct of the
   language. It has a type parameter that determines the "return type" of invoking the
   visitor on an expression. This type parameter is used in all positions in which
   the original syntax specifies a subexpression.
   
 * Internal visitors also correspond to a "bottom-up" traversal of the syntax tree. */

case class Visitor[T](num: Int => T, add: (T, T) => T, mul: (T, T) => T, id: Symbol => T)
// an alternative to this design is to define num, add, mul, id as abstract methods
// and then create concrete visitors by subclassing or trait composition.

/* The fold function itself applies a visitor to an expression. 
 * Note that the recursion is performed in the fold function, hence
 * all visitors are not recursive.
 
 * Also note that this design enforces that all algorithms specified via this visitor
 * interfaces are compositional by design. This means that the recursion structure of
 * the algorithm corresponds to the recursion structure of the expression. Put in another
 * way, it means that the semantics (in terms of the meta-language) of a composite 
 * expression is determined by the semantics of the subexpressions; the syntax of the
 * subexpressions is irrelevant.

 * Compositional specifications are particularly nice because they enable "equational
 * reasoning": Subexpressions can be replaced by other subexpressions with the same 
 * semantics without changing the semantics of the whole.

/* We will now learn a different "data-less" representation of expressions inspired by
 * the visitor infrastructure above. This representation is called "Church Encoding"
 * or sometimes, when used in statically typed languages, "BÃ¶hm-Berarducci Encoding".
 *
 * The idea of this representation is that the expression tree is a kind of intermediate
 * result that we can skip and go straight to the result of applying a visitor. That is,
 * we represent an expression by a function that will call the "right" functions of a visitor.
 * 
 * For instance, we want to represent the expression "test" by the function: */
def foldForTest[T](v: Visitor[T]): T = foldExp(v, test)
/* except that we want to skip the construction (in the definition of test) and subsequent
 * deconstruction(in the pattern match of foldExp) of the data type and represent the expression
 * directly by the corresponding sequence of calls to the visitor.
 *
 * One advantage of this "data-less" representation is that, due to short-circuiting the
 * construction and subsequent deconstruction of the abstract syntax tree, the interpreter
 * is more efficient. For instance, no pattern matching is needed anymore.
 *
 * Recommended exercise: "Partially evaluate" foldForTest, that is, inline the definition of 
 * foldExp and specialize it to the case e = test.
 *
 * Hence, an expression is represented by a function that, for any type T, applies 
 * a Visitor[T] to itself and thereby produces a T.
 * 
 * The "for any type T" from the previous sentence means that ordinary Scala functions cannot
 * be used for this purpose, because all type parameters of Scala functions have to be known 
 * before a function can be passed as an argument. Rather, we encode it as an abstract class 
 * with an "apply" function that takes the type parameter.
 * 
 * Later in the course, or if you are a Haskell affectionado, you may recognize that this is
 * an encoding of the type "forall T.Visitor[T] => T", which means that functions accepting or 
 * returning ExpC values have so-called "rank-2 types".
