/* F1-WAE, the language with first-order functions, lets us abstract over patterns
 * that involve numbers. But what if we want to abstract over patterns that
 * involve functions, such as the "list fold" pattern, whose instantiations
 * include summing or multiplying a list of integers?
 * 
 * To enable this kind of abstraction, we need to make functions "first-class",
 * which means that they become values that can be passed to or returned from
 * functions or stored in data structures. Languages with first-class functions
 * enable so-called "higher-order functions", which are functions that accept or
 * return a (possibly again higher-order) function.
 *
 * We will see that this extension will make our language both simpler and much
 * more powerful. This seeming contradiction is famously addressed by the first
 * sentence of the Scheme language specification:
 *
 *  "Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of 
 *   feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional 
 *   features appear necessary."
 * 
 * The simplicity is due to the fact that this language is so expressive that many
 * other language features can be "encoded", i.e., they do not need to be added
 * to the language but can be expressed with the existing features.
 *
 * This language, which we call "FAE", is basically the so-called "lambda calculus",
 * a minimal but powerful programming language that has been highly influential
 * in the design and theory of programming languages. 
 *
 * FAE is the language of arithmetic expressions, AE, plus only two additional
 * language constructs: Function abstraction and function application.

/* Due to the lambda calculus, the concrete syntax for function abstraction is
 * often written with a lambda, such as "lambda x. x+3", thus also called lambda
 * abstraction. The Scala syntax for lambda terms is " (x) => x+3", the Haskell
 * syntax is "\x -> x+3".
 * 
 * The concrete syntax for function application is often either 
 * juxtaposition "f a" or using brackets "f(a)". Haskell and the lambda calculus
 * use the former, Scala uses the latter.
 *
 * The "with" construct is not needed anymore since it can be encoded
 * using App and Fun. For instance, "with x = 7 in x+3" can be encoded
 * (using Scala syntax) as " ((x) => x+3)(7)
 *
 * We make this idea explicit by giving a constructive translation. Such translations
 * are also often called "desugaring".

/* However, what happens if e2 contains free variables? The danger
 * here is that they may be accidentially "captured" by the substitution.
 * For instance, consider 
 *
 *  subst(Fun('x, Add('x,'y)), 'y, Add('x,5))
 *
 * The result is Fun('x,Add('x,Add('x,5)))
 * 
 * This is not desirable, since it violates again static scoping.
 *
 * Note that this problem did not show up in earlier languages, because
 * there we only substituted variables by numbers, but not by expressions
 * that may contain free variables: The type of e2 was "Num" and not "Exp".
 *
 * Hence we are still not done with defining substitution.
 * But what is the desired result of the substitution above?
 * The answer is that we must avoid the name clash by renaming the variable
 * bound by the "lambda" if the variable name occurs free in e2. This new
 * variable name should be "fresh", i.e., not occur free in e2.
 * 
 * For instance, in the example above, we could first rename 'x to the fresh name
 * 'x0 and only then substitute, i.e. 
 *
 *   subst(Fun('x, Add('x,'y)), 'y, Add('x,5)) == Fun('x0,Add(Id('x0),Add(Id('x),Num(5))))
 *
 * Let's do this step by step.

 *
 * But how do we evaluate a function abstraction? Obviously we cannot return a number.
 *
 * We realize that functions are also values! Hence we have to broaden the return type of
 * our evaluator to also allow functions as values. 
 * 
 * For simplicity, we use "Exp" as our return type since it allows us to return both
 * numbers and functions. Later we will become more sophisticated.
 *
 * This means that a new class of errors can occur: A subexpression evaluates to a number
 * where a function is expected, or vice versa. Such errors are called _type errors_, and
 * we will talk about them in much more detail later. For now, it means that we need to
 * analyze (typically by pattern matching) the result of recursive invocations of eval to
 * check whether the result has the right type.
 *
 * The remainder of the interpreter is unsurprising.

 * The problem is that we have forgotten the deferred substitutions to be performed
 * in the body of the function.

 * What can we do to fix this problem?
 *
 * We could try to replace the second line in the "App" case by
 *     case Fun(x,body) => evalWithEnv0(body, env + (x -> evalWithEnv0(a,env)))
 * but this would again introduce dynamic scoping.
 *
 * Hence, when we evaluate a function, we do not only have to store the function, but also
 * the environment active when the function was created. This pair of function and environment
 * is called a _closure_. The environment stored in the closure is used when the function is
 * eventually applied.
 *
 * Hint: If you cannot answer what a closure is and how it is used in the 
 * interpreter, you will be toast in the exam!
 *
 * Since closures are not expressible in the language syntax, we now come to the point where
 * we need a separate category of _values_. The values in FAE can be either numbers or closures.
